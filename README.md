# Backuper-service
The program is a Windows service that allows you to create full and differential backup copies of data on network storages and FTP servers.
Supports shadow copying. The service receives settings from the MS SQL server. 
The results of the backup are sent to the server and the monitoring program informs you of the success or failure of the backup task.
